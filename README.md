DNAGPT2- The Best Beginner's Guide to Gene Sequence Large Language Models

### 1. Overview
Large language models have long transcended the NLP research domain, becoming a cornerstone for AI in science. Gene sequences in bioinformatics are most similar to natural language, making the application of large models to biological sequence studies a hot research direction in recent years. The 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry awarded to AlphaFold for predicting protein structures has further illuminated the future path for biological research.

However, for most biologists, large models remain unfamiliar territory. Until 2023, models like GPT were niche topics within NLP research, only gaining public attention due to the emergence of ChatGPT.

Most biology + large model research has emerged post-2023, but the significant interdisciplinary gap means these studies are typically collaborative efforts by large companies and teams. Replicating or learning from this work is challenging for many researchers, as evidenced by the issues sections of top papers on GitHub.

On one hand, large models are almost certain to shape the future of biological research; on the other, many researchers hesitate at the threshold of large models. Providing a bridge over this gap is thus an urgent need.

DNAGTP2 serves as this bridge, aiming to facilitate more biologists in overcoming the large model barrier and leveraging these powerful tools to advance their work.

### 2. Tutorial Characteristics
